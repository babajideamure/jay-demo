        <h2>What is Application Scaling?</h2>
        <p>Scaling refers to the process of adjusting the resources (like servers and databases) to accommodate traffic increases. AWS makes scaling simple and automated, allowing your web applications to grow or shrink as needed, ensuring consistent performance and minimal downtime.</p>

        <h2>Key AWS Tools for Web Application Scaling</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AWS Auto Scaling:</strong> Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances or other resources based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):</strong> Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to prevent any one server from being overwhelmed with requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Amazon CloudFront:</strong> AWS's Content Delivery Network (CDN) caches content at edge locations, improving load times and reducing server load for global users.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS Lambda:</strong> Run your code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda scales automatically in response to incoming traffic, making it ideal for event-driven applications.</li>
        </ul>
